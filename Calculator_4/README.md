- Python 3.x

Tkinter comes bundled with most Python distributions. If it's not available, install it via:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk    # Linux


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.  
2. Save the script as `calculator.py`.

## üßæ Code Overview

- **Tkinter**: Used for GUI creation.
- **Entry widget**: To input and show expressions.
- **Button widgets**: For digits, operators, equal, and clear.
- **eval()**: Evaluates arithmetic expressions entered via the UI.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This calculator uses Python‚Äôs `eval()` to compute expressions. While it is safe in this context due to button-only input, `eval()` should be avoided in security-sensitive applications.
